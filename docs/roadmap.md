# Stratos Roadmap

Last Updated: 25 April 2018

## Agile

We work on a 2-week Sprint cycle. Sprints start on Wednesdays. For reference, Sprint 27 started 4 April 2018.

We are using GitHub issues to track all work items. We use ZenHub to manage these in an agile fashion - see: https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/boards

## High-Level Features

The high-level features that we schedule into the roadmap are identified by the ```feature-request``` label. You can see the current set of features [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request).

## Schedule

We are currently focused on completing out the core features to get V2 on par with V1.

We will shortly review progress and the remaining work and publish a tentative schedule.

Beyond the release of V2, we expect to move to a sprit-based release schedule, publishing a new release every 2 weeks.
